<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Heyy Their I am Piyush Tiwari from Vapi gujarat and i belong to Rajasthan.
  And i am just an ordinary man who have some extraordinary dreams.
  And i am trying my best to do it everyday and learn to do things on my own.
  Some people thinks that i have a ego problem but i dont think so that i have one.
</p>

<p>According to peoples everyone who have some dreams and wanna achieve it rather 
  than being a party rat with them are being rude to them and have Ego.
  And if i am such kinda rude then i will like to be that everyday.And i think i am on the right
  path now to achieve my dreams.
</p>

<p>And yes, i had also forgetten my dreams while chasing the unwanted things.
  According to me everyone once goes to wrong path once in life and only that teaches
  us to why one should always listen to Family not to others.Everyone else is not
  family.And after following wrong things i got to know why theirs is differentiation
  between friends,colleagues, classmates,cousins and Family.Not everyone is your friend.
</p>

<p>
  I was also in my downfall but their were only my family who was supporting me at my lowest.
  Not a single one bcoz of whom i forgotted my destiny was their.People were also making fun 
  of me.But i have the Best one with my side.And bcoz of them only i am afriad of none,not a single one.
  Bcoz i know if i got something there are my loving sisters who can do everything for me.
  And my one and only BEST FRIEND PAPA & MUMMA.He is always their for me.
</p>
